# Solidity 101 for Blockchain - Mboa Program
## Overview
Welcome to the Solidity 101 course, part of the Mboa program. This course is designed to introduce participants to the fundamentals of Solidity, the programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Whether you're new to blockchain or an experienced programmer looking to dive into smart contracts, this course will provide you with the essential knowledge needed to get started with Solidity.

## Course Structure
The course is divided into several key sections, each focusing on a specific aspect of Solidity. We begin with an introduction to Solidity, its syntax, and key concepts, and gradually move towards more complex topics such as functions, modifiers, and contract deployment.


## 1. Introduction to Solidity
- What is Solidity?

    Solidity is an object-oriented, high-level language influenced by JavaScript, C++, and Python. It is primarily used to implement smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.

- Smart Contracts

    Smart contracts are programs stored on the blockchain that execute when predefined conditions are met. They are essential for creating decentralized applications (DApps) and automated transactions on the blockchain.

## 2. Key Concepts in Solidity
- SPDX-License-Identifier

    To avoid legal issues related to copyright, Solidity files should start with an SPDX-License-Identifier, such as // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT.

- Pragma and Versioning

    The pragma keyword is used to specify compiler versions. This ensures that the contract is only compiled with compatible versions of the Solidity compiler.

## 3. Variables and Data Types
- State, Local, and Global Variables

    Learn about the different types of variables in Solidity and how they are used within contracts.

- Data Types

    Explore various data types in Solidity, including strings, arrays, enums, and structs, and understand their significance in smart contract development.

## 4. Functions in Solidity
- Defining Functions

    Understand how to define functions in Solidity, including the use of parameters and return values.

- Modifiers

    Learn about function modifiers, which allow you to control the execution flow of functions based on certain conditions.

- View, Pure, and Payable Functions

    Delve into different types of functions in Solidity, including those that interact with the blockchain state, those that donâ€™t, and those that handle Ether transactions.

## 5. Advanced Topics
- Fallback and Receive Functions

    Explore special functions that handle non-existent function calls and Ether transactions sent to contracts.

- Constructor

    Understand the role of the constructor in initializing contract state variables when the contract is deployed.

## Conclusion
Solidity is a powerful and flexible programming language that is central to Ethereum blockchain development. By the end of this course, participants will have a solid understanding of Solidity's core features and be well-equipped to start building their own smart contracts.

## Next Steps
This course is just the beginning. We encourage participants to continue exploring Solidity through hands-on practice and advanced topics. Stay tuned for the upcoming "Advanced Solidity" course, where we will dive deeper into the intricacies of smart contract development.
